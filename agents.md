**Goal:** Produce dense optical flow from low-res video and upscale to 16K.

**Tools / Nodes:**
- Stock ComfyUI Video Loader (VHS) - replaces VideoFramesLoader
- RAFTFlowExtractor - RAFT-based optical flow extraction
- FlowSRRefine - Flow upsampling with guided filtering
- FlowToSTMap - Convert flow to STMap format

**Key Params:**

- `blend_strength`: 0.3 (temporal consistency)
- `output_format`: png/exr/jpg

**Deliverables:**
- Warped sequence [B, 16K, 16K, 3]
- Temporally stabilized frames
- Frame files: output_XXXX.png/exr/jpg

**Status:** Production-ready with seamless tiling

### Agent C — Mesh Maestro ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Optional)
**Goal:** Build an adaptive mesh and warp via barycentric interpolation.

**Tools / Nodes:**

## Implemented ComfyUI Workflows ✅

### Graph 1 — Flow-to-STMap-to-Warp (Core Pipeline) ✅ PRODUCTION READY
**Recommended for most users - fastest and most reliable**

```
1. VHS Video Loader -> images [B, H, W, C]
2. RAFTFlowExtractor(images) -> flow [B-1, H, W, 2], confidence
3. LoadImage (16K still) -> still_image [1, H16K, W16K, C]
4. FlowSRRefine(flow, still_image) -> flow_upscaled [B-1, H16K, W16K, 2]
5. FlowToSTMap(flow_upscaled) -> stmap [B-1, H16K, W16K, 3]
6. TileWarp16K(still_image, stmap) -> warped_frames [B-1, H16K, W16K, C]
7. TemporalConsistency(warped_frames, flow_upscaled) -> stabilized [B-1, H16K, W16K, C]
8. HiResWriter(stabilized) -> output_XXXX.png/exr
```

**Parameters:**
- Video: 720p-1080p, 16-30fps
- Still: 16K (or any high resolution)
- tile_size: 2048 (24GB VRAM) or 1024 (12GB VRAM)
- overlap: 128 pixels
- raft_iters: 12-20

**Output:** Seamless 16K frame sequence

### Graph 2 — Mesh-Warp Variant ✅ FUNCTIONAL
**For large deformations, character animation, fabric/cloth**

```
1. VHS Video Loader -> images
2. RAFTFlowExtractor(images) -> flow
3. MeshBuilder2D(flow) -> mesh_sequence [MESH type]
4. AdaptiveTessellate(mesh_sequence, flow) -> refined_mesh
5. LoadImage (16K still) -> still_image
6. BarycentricWarp(still_image, refined_mesh) -> warped_frames
7. TemporalConsistency(warped_frames, flow) -> stabilized
8. HiResWriter(stabilized) -> output files
```

**When to use:**
- Surfaces bend/fold significantly
- Better stability on edges compared to pixel-based flow
- Can handle more extreme non-rigid deformations

**Note:** Slower than Graph 1 due to triangle rasterization

### Graph 3 — 3D-Proxy Variant ✅ EXPERIMENTAL
**For camera motion, parallax-heavy shots**

```
1. VHS Video Loader -> images
2. RAFTFlowExtractor(images) -> flow
3. DepthEstimator(images) -> depth_maps [B, H, W, 1]
4. LoadImage (16K still) -> still_image
5. ProxyReprojector(still_image, depth_maps, flow) -> reprojected [B, H16K, W16K, C]
6. TemporalConsistency(reprojected, flow) -> stabilized
7. HiResWriter(stabilized) -> output files
```

**When to use:**
- Significant camera movement
- Foreground/background parallax separation
- Architectural or landscape shots

**Limitations:**
- Currently uses placeholder depth estimation
- Full camera pose estimation planned for future
- Best results with real MiDaS/DPT depth models

## Implementation Notes

### Performance ✅ Implemented
- **Tiled processing**: 2048×2048 tiles with 128px feathered overlap
- **Memory efficiency**: Weighted accumulation buffers for seamless stitching
- **Batch processing**: All nodes handle batch dimensions properly
- **Model caching**: RAFT model cached between invocations

### Future Optimizations ⏳
- CUDA kernels for 5-10× speedup on TileWarp16K
- Mip-pyramids of still for better sampling under large warps
- Multi-GPU support: split time-range across GPUs
- Pinned memory for faster tile I/O

### Reliability Features ✅
- **Flow confidence maps**: Generated by RAFTFlowExtractor
- **Guided filtering**: Edge-aware flow upsampling prevents bleeding
- **Temporal consistency**: Reduces flicker via flow-based blending
- **Graceful degradation**: Bilateral filter fallback if opencv-contrib missing

### Future Enhancements ⏳
- Forward-backward flow consistency for occlusion detection
- Global affine stabilization before local warp
- Temporal hole-filling and inpainting

### Integration ✅
- **STMap format**: Compatible with Nuke STMap node, After Effects RE:Map
- **EXR export**: 16-bit half precision (linear) when OpenEXR installed
- **ComfyUI native**: Uses standard IMAGE type, integrates with all ComfyUI nodes

### Future Integrations ⏳
- Alembic mesh export for 3D software (Blender, Maya, Houdini)
- OCIO color management for ACES workflows
- ProRes/DNxHR video encoding
